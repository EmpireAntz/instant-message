## Functions of Convo
- As a user, when you access the home page
- You will be prompted to either log in, or create a new user,
- When creating a new user, you will need to submit a username, valid email, and at minimum an 8 character password,
- Afer you create a user or log in, you will find yourself on the home page, to get started you will need to click search on the top left
- When search is clicked, you will be prompted to input your friends email,
- If their email is valid, a card will be generated containing their user name and email and an Add friend button.
- Once a friend is added you can return to your homepage and a new card with your friends name will be generated.
- The card will contain your friends user name and a button called Chat Now!
- By clicking on Chat Now! You will be redirected to your individual chat forum with your friend.
- From there you will be able to write and submit messages which will be recieved by your friend and vise versa!
- Now your messages will be stored and recalled whenever you access that friends chat!
